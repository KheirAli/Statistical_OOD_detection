"""Reconstruction samplers with a common interface.

All samplers satisfy the `Sampler` ABC in `base.py`. Every sampler is registered
in `SAMPLERS` below and instantiated via `build_sampler(name, unet, config)`.

Adding a new sampler:
  1. Create `ood/samplers/<name>.py` with a subclass of `Sampler`.
  2. Import it here and add to the `SAMPLERS` dict.
  3. Parametrized tests in `tests/test_samplers.py` auto-cover the new entry.
